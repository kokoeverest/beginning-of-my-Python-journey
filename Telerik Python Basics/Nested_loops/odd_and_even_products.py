lines = int(input())


for _ in range()


# You are given N integers, each on a new line

#     Write a program that checks whether the product of the odd lines is equal to the product of the /
# even lines.
#     Lines are counted from 1 to N, so the first line is odd, the second is even, etc.

# Input

#     On the first line you will receive the number N
#     On each of the next N lines, you will receive a number

# Output

#     If the two products are equal, output a string in the format "yes PRODUCT_VALUE", otherwise /
# write on the console "no ODD_PRODUCT_VALUE EVEN_PRODUCT_VALUE"

# Constraints

#     N will always be a valid integer number in the range [4, 50]
#     All input numbers will also be valid integers in range
