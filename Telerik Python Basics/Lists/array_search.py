# Given an array of integers, some elements appear twice and others appear once. Each integer is in the \
# range of [1, N], where N is the number of elements in the array.

# Find all the integers of [1, N] inclusive that do NOT appear in this array.

# Input
# Read from the standard input:

# There is one line of input, containing N amount of integers, seperated by a comma (",")
# Output
# Print to the standard output:

# There is one line of output, containing the sorted integers, seperated by a comma (",")
# Constraints
# N will always be in the range of [5, 1000]
