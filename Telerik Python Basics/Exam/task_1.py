# Magic Numbers
# Given an array of exactly 5 numbers, find those that can be divided both to 3 and 7. Then, sum them all up and find the number /
# that will be the result of the sum of the numberâ€™s digits.


# ###Example:

# Numbers: '21 42 50 126 300'
# Numbers that can be divided both to 3 and 7: '21 42 126'
# Sum: '21 + 42 + 126 = 189'
# Digits' sum: '1 + 8 + 9 = 18'
# Input
# Read from the standard input

# Exactly 5 numbers.
# Output
# Print on the standard output

# The result of the calculated sum.
# Sample tests
# Input
# 21 42 50 126 300
# Output
# 18
