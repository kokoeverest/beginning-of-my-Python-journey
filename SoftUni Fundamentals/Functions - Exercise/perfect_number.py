# A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors. That is the sum
# of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum).
# Write a function that receives an integer number and returns one of the following messages:
#     • "We have a perfect number!" - if the number is perfect.
#     • "It's not so perfect." - if the number is NOT perfect.
# Print the result on the console.
