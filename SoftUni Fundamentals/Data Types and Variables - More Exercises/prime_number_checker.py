# Write a program to check if a number is prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1,
# not a product of two smaller natural numbers. For example, the only ways of writing 5 as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1,
# involve 5 itself.
# The input comes as an integer number.
# The output should be True if the number is prime and False otherwise.
